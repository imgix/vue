## Overview / Resources

**Before you get started with vue-imgix**, it's _highly recommended_ that you read Eric Portis' [seminal article on `srcset` and `sizes`](https://ericportis.com/posts/2014/srcset-sizes/). This article explains the history of responsive images in responsive design, why they're necessary, and how all these technologies work together to save bandwidth and provide a better experience for users. The primary goal of react-imgix is to make these tools easier for developers to implement, so having an understanding of how they work will significantly improve your react-imgix experience.

Below are some other articles that help explain responsive imagery, and how it can work alongside imgix:

- [Using imgix with `<picture>`](https://docs.imgix.com/tutorials/using-imgix-picture-element). Discusses the differences between art direction and resolution switching, and provides examples of how to accomplish art direction with imgix.
- [Responsive Images with `srcset` and imgix](https://docs.imgix.com/tutorials/responsive-images-srcset-imgix). A look into how imgix can work with `srcset` and `sizes` to serve the right image.

## Get Started

Firstly, follow this [quick start guide](https://docs.imgix.com/setup/quick-start) to set-up an imgix account.

Then, install vue-imgix with the following commands, depending on your package manager.

- **NPM**: `npm install vue-imgix`
- **Yarn**: `yarn add vue-imgix`

This module exports two transpiled versions. If a ES6-module-aware bundler is being used to consume this module, it will pick up an ES6 module version and can perform tree-shaking. **If you are not using ES6 modules, you don't have to do anything.**

Finally, vue-imgix needs to be initialized before if can be used in components. Modify `App.vue` or similar to include the following:

```js
import { initVueImgix } from 'vue-imgix';

initVueImgix({
  domain: "<your company's imgix domain>",
});
```

And that's all you need to get started! Have fun!

## Usage

The main idea here is that you should be able to use this component just as you would an `<img />` tag.

### Examples

#### Basic Use Case

To render a simple image that will display an image based on the browser's dpr and the width of the rendered element using the power of srcsets, vue-imgix can be used as follows:

```html
<Imgix :src="examples/pione.jpg" sizes="100vw" />
```

**Please note:** `100vw` is an appropriate `sizes` value for a full-bleed image. If your image is not full-bleed, you should use a different value for `sizes`. [Eric Portis' "Srcset and sizes"](https://ericportis.com/posts/2014/srcset-sizes/) article goes into depth on how to use the `sizes` attribute.

This will generate HTML similar to the following:

```html
<img
  src="https://assets.imgix.net/examples/pione.jpg?auto=format"
  sizes="100vw"
  srcset="
    https://assets.imgix.net/examples/pione.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=100 100w,
    https://assets.imgix.net/examples/pione.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=200 200w,
    ...
  "
/>
```

#### Flexible Image Rendering

This component acts dynamically by default. The component will leverage `srcset` and `sizes` to render the right size image for its container. This is an example of this responsive behaviour.

`sizes` should be set properly for this to work well, and some styling should be used to set the size of the component rendered. Without `sizes` and correct styling the image might render at full-size.

`./styles.css`

```css
.App {
  display: flex;
}

.App > img {
  margin: 10px auto;
  width: 10vw;
  height: 200px;
}
```

`./app.js`

```html
<div className="App">
  <Imgix src="examples/pione.jpg" sizes="calc(10% - 10px)" />
</div>
```

**Aspect Ratio:** A developer can pass a desired aspect ratio, which will be used when
generating srcsets to resize and crop your image as specified. For the `ar` parameter to take effect, ensure that the `fit` parameter is set to `crop`.

```html
<div className="App">
  <Imgix
    src="examples/pione.jpg"
    sizes="calc(10% - 10px)"
    imgixParams="{ ar: '16:9' }"
  />
</div>
```

The aspect ratio is specified in the format `width:height`. Either dimension can be an integer or a float. All of the following are valid: 16:9, 5:1, 1.92:1, 1:1.67.

#### Fixed Image Rendering (i.e. non-flexible)

If the fluid, dynamic nature explained above is not desired, the width and height can be set explicitly.

```js
<Imgix
  src="examples/pione.jpg"
  width="100" // This sets what resolution the component should load from the CDN and the size of the resulting image
  height="200"
/>
```

Fixed image rendering will automatically append a variable `q` parameter mapped to each `dpr` parameter when generating a srcset. This technique is commonly used to compensate for the increased filesize of high-DPR images. Since high-DPR images are displayed at a higher pixel density on devices, image quality can be lowered to reduce overall filesize without sacrificing perceived visual quality. For more information and examples of this technique in action, see [this blog post](https://blog.imgix.com/2016/03/30/dpr-quality).
This behavior will respect any overriding `q` value passed in via `imgixParams` and can be disabled altogether with the boolean property `disableQualityByDPR`.

```js
<Imgix src="image.jpg" width="100" disableQualityByDPR />
```

will generate the following srcset:

```html
https://domain.imgix.net/image.jpg?q=75&w=100&dpr=1 1x,
https://domain.imgix.net/image.jpg?q=50&w=100&dpr=2 2x,
https://domain.imgix.net/image.jpg?q=35&w=100&dpr=3 3x,
https://domain.imgix.net/image.jpg?q=23&w=100&dpr=4 4x,
https://domain.imgix.net/image.jpg?q=20&w=100&dpr=5 5x
```

### Advanced Examples

For advanced use cases which go above the basic usage outlined above, such as lazy loading, or integration with other components or libraries, this library provides a set of low-level APIs.

#### buildUrlObject

This function is provided a convenient way to generate values to pass to the src and srcset attributes.

In a component:

```html
<template>
  <img
    :src="advancedSrcObject.src"
    :srcset="advancedSrcObject.srcset"
    sizes="50vw"
  />
</template>

<script>
  import { buildUrlObject } from '@/plugins/vue-imgix';

  // NB: Make sure initVueImgix has been called before this code runs
  export default {
    name: 'advanced-build-url-object',

    computed: {
      advancedSrcObject: () =>
        buildUrlObject('examples/pione.jpg', {
          auto: 'format',
        }),
    },
  };
</script>
```

#### buildUrl

In addition to the helper above, we provide `buildURL` from imgix-core-js to help developers to create any URL they need.

```html
<template>
  <img :src="advancedUrl" />
</template>

<script>
  import { buildUrl } from '@/plugins/vue-imgix';

  // NB: Make sure initVueImgix has been called before this code runs
  export default {
    name: 'advanced-build-url',

    computed: {
      advancedUrl: () =>
        buildUrl('examples/pione.jpg', {
          auto: 'format',
        }),
    },
  };
</script>
```

#### buildSrcSet

We also provide `buildSrcSet` from imgix-core-js to help developers to create any srcset URL they need.

```html
<template>
  <img :src="advancedSrc" :srcset="advancedSrcSet" />
</template>

<script>
  import { buildUrl, buildSrcSet } from '@/plugins/vue-imgix';

  // NB: Make sure initVueImgix has been called before this code runs
  export default {
    name: 'advanced-build-srcset',

    computed: {
      advancedUrl: () =>
        buildUrl('examples/pione.jpg', {
          auto: 'format',
        }),
      advancedSrcSet: () =>
        buildSrcSet('examples/pione.jpg', {
          auto: 'format',
        }),
    },
  };
</script>
```
